# Data analytics and machine learning

## **Heart_Disease_Dataset_Sklearn_Tensorflow_** ##
This is my data analytics for the popular heart disease dataset. In this analytics i tested how different classifier and a keras model perform on different feature engineered datasets.
 
This is my latest project. So if you are interested in my current skills, take a look at this. - 28.04.2020
 

## Iris_Dataset_Sklearn_ ##
This is my data analytics for the popular "Iris" dataset. After some feature engineering i trained different sklearn classifier to determine which one performs the best.

 
## Iris_Dataset_Tensorflow_ ##
This is my data analytics for the popular "Iris" dataset. After some feature engineering i trained a Keras model to determine which type of iris it is based on the given iris features.

## Titanic_Dataset_Tensorflow_ ##
This is my data analytics for the popular Titanic dataset. After some feature engineering i trained a Keras model to determine if a passenger would die or survive.
